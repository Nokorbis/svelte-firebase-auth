### TL;DR

To use it, set your credentials in firebase.js file. And thatÂ´s it!

# Svelte Firebase Auth App

This is my project to speed up the process of creating an authenticated web app. 

## Quick start

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd svelte-firebase-auth
npm install
```

...then set up your firebase credentials in [firebase.js](https://github.com/ricalamino/svelte-firebase-auth/blob/master/src/firebase.js) file

...finally run your test environment:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running. Edit any component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.


## Deploying to the web

To create all static the files just run...

```bash
npm run build
```

All the files to deploy the web app are in `public/` folder.
